## Key bindings

Some packages will override key bindings. If you have problems with a specific key shortcut,
you can add it to your User - Key Bindings file ```Preferences > Key Bindings - User```

You can also use ```sublime.log_commands(True)``` in the console (```ctrl+~```) to output key presses.

##Completions and Snippets
**Note**: A classic completions plug-in is available from @bbluemel which can be downloaded at

https://github.com/bbluemel/ColdFusionTagCompletions
***
Although, this package includes CFScript completions (```.sublime-completions```) and ColdFusion tag completions (API-injected), it's recommended that you create your own custom snippets using code that fits your particular coding style.
To create a new snippet select ```Tools > New Snippet...``` from the Sublime Text menu.
Use ```<scope>text.html.cfm - string</scope>``` for ColdFusion markup snippets and ```<scope>source.cfscript - string</scope>``` for CFScript snippets.

Completions in order of priority are:
* Snippets
* API-injected completions
* ```.sublime-completions``` files
* words in the current buffer

The following list contains snippets repositories made available by ColdFusion community members:

* https://github.com/indynagpal/sublime-stuff
* https://github.com/bittersweetryan/ColdFusion-Script-Sublime-Snippets

To install snippets just put the ```.sublime-snippet``` files in your Packages/User folder or sub-folder (to get to your Packages/User folder select ```Preferences > Browse Packages...``` from the Sublime Text 2 menu).
