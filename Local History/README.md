# Local History
#### A Sublime Text 2 plugin for maintaining local history of files

##Benefits

* Every time you modify a file, a copy of the old contents is kept in the local history.
* At any time, you can compare or replace a file with any older version from the history.
* View incremental diff of any file form history.
* It can help you out when you change or delete a file by accident.
* The history can also help you out when your workspace has a catastrophic problem or if you get disk errors that corrupt your workspace files.
* Each file revision is stored in a separate file inside the `history` folder.
e.g., `/Users/vrana/.sublime/history/foo/bar/hello.23.2012.10.10.34.history.py`
